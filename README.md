    Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
    -Artemis Financial was a financial services company specializing in creating financial plans for people who wanted to invest. Requirements of their software included having information transfer in a secure manner while also maintaining speed as necessary in a fast paced environment.
    What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?
    -In my opinion, I did a good job in identifying software vulnerabilities through  usage of tools like Dependency Check. Secure code is very important because without it there is potential for personal information to be stolen, lost money, and loss of reputation among other negative aspects. Because of this, secure code helps a company's wellbeing by protecting that sensitive data.
    What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
    -Especially in early stages, I struggled with interpreting the Dependency Check report. Identifying which CVEs were false flags was very difficult for me especially at first, though it did become easier.
    How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
    How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
    -I approached this by writing code using RESTful programming practices. Before the refactoring, I ran a dependency check report, then ran another after the report was created in order to confirm no new vulnerabilities were added. 
    What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
    -The OWASP Top 10 recourse was helpful, as were Dependency Check and the RESTful programming techniques. 
    Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
    -I'd showcase how I wrote code in a way that was secure and conforming to RESTful techniques.
